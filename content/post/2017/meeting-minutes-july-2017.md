I distributed few old "Linux for you" books to the participants.

After the talk, few of us went to gurunath restaurant. Discussed about
bitcoin, blockchain, chennai colleges, having hackathon and trainings
etc. Baskar selvaraj requested to have more offline events like we
were doing few years ago. Remembered contributions of our long time
members like KG, Raaman, Bharathi etc. He shared all the fun happening
at colleges on the events he conducts. It will be really great if we
start more events. Let us plan them and start as soon as possible.

Thanks for all participants and speakers.
