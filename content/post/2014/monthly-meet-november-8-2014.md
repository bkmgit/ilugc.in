### Talk 1: Workflows with Tmux

* Speaker: Shrayas
* Description ​:​ Tmux, or Terminal MUltipleXer is a really sleek way to make your terminal do a LOT more things that you thought it could. It manages windows and panes like a BOSS. 
I usually work on a bunch of things – some work related stuff, some open source projects, some side projecty stuff, writing a blog post, etc. And all these things require my screen to be in some format. 
One of the greatest things about tmux is its ability to manage sessions. You can create a session and make your splits in one fashion and when you are done with the work for that point in time, you can detatch from that session and leave it right that way. When you want to get back to it you can just pick up where you left off. 
The true power of Tmux however lies in applying this session management when you are working on remote boxes. Imagine working at home on a remote box, closing your laptop, travelling to work and picking up *right* where you left off. In addition, pair programming becomes an ease with Tmux. 
It is super simple and it just works. Thats the beauty behind it. In this session, I will try to explain some of the concepts of Tmux that I have learnt in the past few weeks of using Tmux (Note: I’m still a beginner) and the way I use it. I will also demonstrate its power in remote machines and how to use it to pair program.
* Links: Don’t have recordings of any previous talks. But you can find my previous presentation slides over at http://speakerdeck.com/shrayasr
* Duration: 30-45 mins
* About Yourself: My name is Shrayas. I previously worked at SAP Labs Bangalore and now I work with my father at Logic Soft Pvt. Ltd. helping to explore new verticals and do new things. 
I love open source and the whole idea behind F/OSS and have tried my best to contribute where ever I can to them. I do most of my work in terminals with my trusty VIM and Tmux. 
I currently am exploring Pythonand C# at work and side projects. Also I am slowly trying to use FP languages like clojure and racket/scheme where ever I can (though I’m horrible at it :D) 
Otherwise, I am basically from the streets of Mylapore, Chennai. Did my B.Sc from Loyola (any loyolites here?) and my MS during my tenure at SAP.
